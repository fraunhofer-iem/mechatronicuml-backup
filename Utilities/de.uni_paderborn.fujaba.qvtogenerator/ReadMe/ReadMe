This generator needs true and much love :)

In the case of n:n references like port.connectors <-> connector.ports in the muml meta model the order of the resulting references is not guaranteed

If this doesn't bother you or you want to fix occurences of this case in the resulting qvto transformation (and your are very brave) you can use the current state of the generation as follows:

model: Just some dummy model to trigger the generator
model2: This folder should contain your meta models

in QVTOGenerator.xtend Line 25 add all meta models like
	models.add("/de.uni_paderborn.fujaba.qvtogenerator/model2/<your meta model>.ecore".loadModel)
	
right click on QVTOGenerator.mwe2 RunAs -> MWE Workflow





What could be done

- Get rid of the XText Guice Stuff and extend an own abstract Generator Class
- Add Wizards to define the meta models
- Test the commented solution for the ordering problem extensively (late resolve)
- Get rid of multiple traversal of meta models and cache required information
- ....
