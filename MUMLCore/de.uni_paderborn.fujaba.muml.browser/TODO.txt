* Every change that regards another file which is open in an editor finds the other EditingDomain and puts it on the command stack there.
* If no editor is open, create a new EditingDomain for APE.
  -> Here we must listen for changes and safe directly. (see old code for workspace synchronizer)
* In case an Editor is opened, throw away own EditingDomain, and reuse Editor's.
  -> how to find that out? maybe the editor reuses the model browsers EditingDomain?
  -> but then they have too many resources loaded.

* Maybe just have multiple editing domains again.
* -> Only one model file
 
* In the background thread scan and open the whole workspace,
  If the user tries to expand an element that is not yet preloaded,
  show the "Loading..." item.
