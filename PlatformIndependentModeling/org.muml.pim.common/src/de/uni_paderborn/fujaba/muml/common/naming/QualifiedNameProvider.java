/**
 * Main class for computing QualifiedNames for EObjects and superclass of all concrete implementations
 * of QualifiedNameProviders. 
 * <p>You most likely do not want to instantiate this by itself, but use
 * one of the more specific implementations such as the {@link MumlQualifiedNameProvider}.
 * A typical way of instantiating this would be 
 * {@code new MySpecialNameProvider(new MumlQualifiedNameProvider(new QualifiedNameProvider()))},
 * specifying that MySpecialNameProvider should use a MumlQualifiedNameProvider as a 
 * fallback if it does not specify a name computation for an object itself. </p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Notes for implementors</b>:
 * You should inherit from this class and override getQualifiedName(EObject, EObject)
 * (see the method's javadoc for more details).<br>
 * Also, you should create at least one Constructor(QualifiedNameProvider delegate)
 * and all your constructors should call super(delegate) or super() appropriately.
 * This ensures that your delegate and delegationRoot fields are properly populated. 
 * (See {@link MumlQualifiedNameProvider} as an example implementation) </p>
 * 
 * <p>This particular QualifiedNameProvider itself computes a "default" QualifiedName 
 * using the 'name' attribute of the NamedElement class if it exists. This 
 * allows using this QualifiedNameProvider as a convenient fallback (read: delegate) for most 
 * QualifiedName computations.</p> 
 * 
 * <p><b>Implementation notes</b>:
 * The class is based on the notion of delegates as opposed to inheritance 
 * because it is not uncommon that some new language references several metamodels
 * and would wish to unify the QualifiedNameProviders for these metamodels. 
 * This is not possible to solve gracefully using single inheritance.</p>
