Notes about the execution semantics of entry-, exit- and transition actions

Execution order (in terms of actions) of the "entryexit" example project:
    u x v y w z

General execution semantics:
- exit actions (order: from highest to lowest region)
- transition actions (order: from highest to lowest region)
- entry actions (order: from highest to lowest region)

A synchronization does _not_ influence these execution semantics
(see "entryexit" example project). For example, the transition
action "v" is executed before "y", even though y's transition is the
sender of the synchronization.
