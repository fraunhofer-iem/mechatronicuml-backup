\chapter{Advanced requirements}
\label{chap-optional-3}

Here, we list additional requirements which make the scenario more complicated. We define them as optional. 

\begin{itemize}

\item The vehicles should be able to detect any obstacle on the road and break when they get too close.  
\item There is only one type of vehicle. Each vehicle can be \textit{Overtaker}, \textit{Overtakee}, and \textit{Approacher} at any time. 
\item The road is circular. 
\item The velocity mode of each vehicle can be remotely managed. There is a user interface for this purpose.  

\end{itemize}
