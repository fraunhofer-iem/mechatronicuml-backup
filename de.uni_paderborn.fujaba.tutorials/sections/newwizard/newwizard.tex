\section {Creating a NewWizard for a Fujaba Diagram Editor}
Fujaba Diagram Editor share a domain model file (the fujaba model).
Therefore a New Wizard for Fujaba Diagrams must be able to put a new
diagram into an existing model file, without deleting all of its contents.
An abstract implementation for such a New Wizard exists within the
$de.uni\_paderborn.fujaba.newwizard$ plugin.

\subsection {MANIFEST.MF}
In order to use the abstract implementation, make sure that your
$myeditor.custom$ plugin has a dependency to
$de.uni\_paderborn.fujaba.newwizard$.
