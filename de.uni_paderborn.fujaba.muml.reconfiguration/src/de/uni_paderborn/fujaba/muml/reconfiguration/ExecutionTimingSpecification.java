 * This class serves as the abstract super class for all execution 
 * timing specifications. The execution timing specification specifies the duration that a component 
 * needs to execute a reconfiguration that has been requested by the parent 
 * component. The time to execute a reconfiguration, in turn, depends on the 
 * concrete execution procedure. Currently, we support single-phase and 
 * three-phase execution.
